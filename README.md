Grading application for VB.NET programs

This application has been designed to provide an easy platform for grading student Intro to VB.NET programs. The application a host of features to ease the role of the person grading the files; a custom scripting language to define a program space and value system for the application, interactive capabilities with databases used by graded application, the ability to compile and run VB.NET solutions, and many more. 

To accomplish this task, we have implemented tools from across Windows .Net platform, ranging from the latest in Reflection capabilities to old VB6 system32.dlls. Such interactive runtime predictions require hackish implementations of these resources, but come together to provide fully interactive use of a running application. 

The solution for the project is found in VBGrader/GraderSolution/VBGrader.sln. 
In the folder VBGrader/TestingGrader, you can find multiple gradable applications alongside scripts to test the applications with.
