         CS 3340 Project: VB.NET Grader
      </h3>
</center>

<ul>
<li> Create a VB.NET GUI program to grade other VB.NET GUI programs. </li>

<li> Previous approaches:
<ul>
<li> Process </li>

<li> Pipe </li>

<li> Console </li>

<li> File </li>

<li> Event Handler </li>

<li> Class and Data Hiding </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li> The System.Reflection namespace contains types that retrieve information about assemblies, modules, members, parameters, 
        and other entities in managed code by examining their metadata. These types also can be used to manipulate instances 
        of loaded types, for example to hook up events or to invoke methods. To dynamically create types, use the System.Reflection.Emit namespace. 
 </li>

<li> Classes: Thread, Semaphore, Assembly, PropertyInfo, FieldInfo . . . 
<br /> Structures: IntPtr
<br /> Delegate
</li>


<li> This is a group project and each group should have 3 - 4 students from the same section. </li>

<li> Each group must have a group leader, who must send an email to me
by 5:00 PM, Tuesday, April 2, 2013, with the names of all students in the group. </li>

<li> You will lose 10 points if you do not have a group by 5:00 PM, Tuesday, April 2, 2013. </li>

<li> Students in one group may receive different scores on each phase of the project. </li>

<li> Peer evaluation is required for each phase of the project. </li>

<li> Peer evaluation for phase I is due 11 PM, Tuesday, April 16. </li>
</ul>

<h3> The Grader Program from Last Year </h3>
<ul>
<li> The program is a console application. </li>

<li> When running, VBGrader.exe will grade the first exe file in the same folder which is not VBGrader.exe 
    or *.vshost.exe. </li>

<li> For example, it will grade frmLab1.exe when running in the bin\debug folder, 
    and grade YangQ_Lab1.exe when running in folder TestingGrader\Lab1. </li>

<li> The program uses an input file *.in and produces an output file *.out of the same name. </li>

<li> You can change the input file and see the different output file. </li>
</ul>
