<H3>         CS 2340 - Lab 3 (20 points)<BR>Due 9 PM, Wednesday, September 19, 
2012</H3></CENTER>
<P>Create a VB.NET program in MS Visual Studio 2010 that will display the conent 
of a file  in a textbox and search targets within the textbox.</P>
<H5> The Form </H5>
<UL>
  <LI> The program has one form and its title is "Lab3" followed by your full 
  name. </LI>
  <LI> The form name is frmLab3. </LI>
  <LI> The size of the form is (650, 450), the FormBorderStyle is Fixed3D and it 
  has no ControlBox. </LI>
  <LI> The WindowState is Normal and the StartPosition is CenterScreen. </LI>
  <LI> The AcceptButton is btnFind and the CancelButton is btnExit. </LI></UL>
<H5> The File Textbox</H5>
<UL>
  <LI> There is a textbox of size (450, 230) to display the content of a file. 
  </LI>
  <LI> The name of the textbox is txtFile. </LI>
  <LI> The MultiLine property is True with a vertical scrollbar and the WordWrap 
  is False. </LI>
  <LI> It's centered in the form both horizontally and vertically. </LI></UL>
<H5> Command Buttons </H5>
<UL>
  <LI> There are 6 buttons below the file textbox and they all have the default 
  size. </LI>
  <LI> The name is btnFile, btnFind, btnNext, btnSave, btnSaveAs and btnExit, 
  respectively. </LI>
  <LI> The text is "<U>O</U>PEN FILE", "<U>S</U>AVE",     "SAVE <U>A</U>S",  
  "<U>F</U>IND", "<U>N</U>EXT", and "E<U>X</U>IT," respectively.      Each 
  button has an access key indicated by the underlined character. </LI>
  <LI> Clicking the Open File button will display an OpenFileDialog.     The 
  InitialDirectory is "C:\temp;"      the Filter has two items, the first for 
  all files and the second for text files,     and the second item is selected 
  at the beginning.      <BR>     If no file is selected, a message box should 
  be displayed;      the program goes back to the form without doing any thing 
  after the messagebox is closed.      Otherwise, the content of the file will 
  be displayed in the file textbox,     and button Find will get the focus.     
  </LI>
  <LI> Clicking button Find will display an inputbox for the user to enter the 
  search string.      The prompt of the inputbox is "CS234 - Lab3" followed by 
  "Enter a string: " on the next line;     the title is "Search Target".     
  <BR>     If the user enters a string and then clicks OK,     then the program 
  will try to find out if the entered string is in the file textbox.     If the 
  search string is found in the file textbox, then the first occurrence of the 
  string     in the file textbox will be highlighted and the method 
  ScrollToCaret should be called so     the user can see the highlighted text; 
  otherwise a message box will be displayed to indicate     the target is not 
  found.     If no search string is entered, or button Cancel is clicked, a 
  message box should be displayed     to indicate no target is entered.    </LI>
  <LI> Button Next is disabled at the beginning. It will be enabled after a 
  search is successful.      After the button is clicked, the program will 
  search the next occurrence of the target.      If the search is successful, 
  the found occurrence will be highlighted and the user should be able to     
  see the highlighted text without doing anything;     otherwise, a message box 
  will be displayed to say the end of file is reached and the button is 
  disabled.     Whenever a new search is started (button Search is clicked), 
  button NEXT will be disabled;      it will become enabled or remain disabled 
  depending on if the new search is successful or not.    </LI>
  <LI> Clicking button btnSaveAs will pop up a SaveFileDialog.     The 
  InitialDirectory is "C:\temp;"     the Filter has two items, the first for all 
  files and the second for text files,     and the first item is selected at the 
  beginning.      <BR>     If no file is selected/entered, a message box should 
  be displayed;      the program goes back to the form without doing anything.   
     Otherwise, the content of the file textbox will be saved in the specified 
  file. </LI>
  <LI> Clicking button btnSave will save the content of the file textbox to the 
  file openned last time,     or the file Saved As to last time, whichever 
  occured later. </LI>
  <LI> Clicking button EXIT will pop up a msgbox to ask the user "Do you really 
  want to exit?"     The msgbox has two buttons, Yes and No, with information 
  icon.      Only when the user clicks on Yes, the program will terminate. </LI>
  <LI> Pressing ALT+F4 will not terminate the program. </LI></UL>
