</ul>

<h5> The Textbox </h5>

<li> Clicking on the button with any text containing at lease one non-space character in the textbox,
    a message box will be displayed with a different message. Assume the entered text is "CS 234"
    after spaces being removed from both ends, then the message should be 
<pre>
