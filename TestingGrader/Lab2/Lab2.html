<h5> The Six Pairs of Textboxes and Labels </h5>
<ul>
<li> Below the PayRoll label, there are three textboxes on the left and three textboxes on the right.
     All textboxes have the default size, and there a label above each textbox. </li>
<li> The names of the textboxes are txtID, txtRate, txtHours, txtGrossPay, txtDeduction, and txtNetPay. </li>
<li> The three textboxes on the left are displayed top-down, aligned on the left with the same vertical distance between them. 
    The same applies to the three textboxes on the right, and each one on the right is aligned on the top
    with one textbox on the left. </li>
<li> The names of the labels above the textboxes are lblID, lblRate, lblHours, lblGrossPay, lblDeduction, and lblNetPay.
     The texts of the labels are "ID," "Rate," "Hours," "Gross Pay," "Deduction," and "Net Pay." </li>
<li> Each label is aligned on the left with the textboxe below it.
 </li>
<li> All the labels have the default font with the TextAligh being MiddleLeft . </li>
<li> The entier group of controls are centered in the form both horizontally and vertically. </li>
<li> The three textboxes on the left are used to get input values. 
    <ul>
    <li> TextAlign is Left. </li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li> The three textboxes on the right are used to display output values. 
    <ul>
    <li> TextAlign is Right. </li>
    <li> All values must be in Currency format.</li>
    <li> All are ReadOnly. </li>

    The underlined characters are the access keys. </li>
<li> The three buttons are horizontally centered in the form with the same horizontally distance between them. </li>
<li> Button <u>C</u>OMPUTE is the AcceptButton and button E<u>X</u>IT is the CancelButton of the form. </li>
</ul>


<h5> Tab Order </h5>
<ul>
<li> Textbox txtID has the focus when the program starts. </li>
<li> When the Tab key is pressed, the focus will go to txtRate, txtHours, btnCompute, btnReset, btnExit,
    and then back to txtID. </li>
<li> The output textboxes on the right will not receive focus when the Tab key is pressed. </li>    
</ul>


<h5> The Click Event of btnCompute </h5>
<ul>
<li> The program will check the input values when btnCompute is clicked. </li>
<li> The values will be checked top-down, and when one invalid value is found, 
    the remaining will not be checked.</li>
<li> When one input value is found invalid, 
    the focus will go to the corresponding textbox so the user can enter the input again.</li>
<li> The ID must have at least one non-space character. Otherwise, a message box will be displayed with
    the following message:
<pre>
      Enter the ID please!
</pre>
</li>
    <li> Rate must be a positive number. Otherwise, a message box will be displayed with
    one of the two following messages on two lines:
<pre>
      Invalid Rate!
      Rate must be a number!

      Invalid Rate!
      Rate must be positive!
</pre>            
    <li> Hours must be non-negative number. Otherwise, a message box will be displayed with
    one of the two following messages on two lines:
<pre>
      Invalid Hours!
      Hours must be a number!

      Invalid Hours!
      Hours must be non-negative!
</pre>            

</li>
<li> A string in scientific notation such as "2e3" will be considered as an invalid number. </li>
<li> If all input values are valid, the program will compute the Gross Pay, Deduction, and Net Pay.</li>     
<li> The Gross Pay is the product of Hours and Rate when Hours is at most 40.</li>
<li> Any hours above 40 are overtime hours and
    are paid one time and half of the regular rate. </li>
<li> The Deduction is 33% of the Gross Pay, and the Net Pay is the difference of the Gross Pay
    and the Deduction. </li>
<li> All output values must be displayed in the currency format.
</ul>


<h5> The Click Event of btnReset </h5>
<ul>
<li> The program will clear all textboxes and move the focus to txtID when btnReset is clicked. </li>
</ul>

<h5> The Click Event of btnExit </h5>
<ul>
<li> The program will terminate when btnExit is clicked. </li>
</ul>


<h5> Submission </h5>
<ul>
<li> Drop your executable file to folder Lab2 in the class DropBox by the due time.  </li> 
<li> No Grace Time!  </li> 
<li> The name of the executable file must be UserName_Lab2, where UserName is your UWP UserName. </li>
