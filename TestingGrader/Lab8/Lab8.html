</h4></center>

Create a VB.NET program in MS Visual Studio 2010 to display and search records of a database table.
The program has one form only.
The database file is MyCompany.mdb and it <b>must</b> be in folder C:\Temp.


<h5> The Description </h5>
<ul>
<li> The form has no control box and its title is "Lab8."
     The StartPosition is center screen, the Window state is normal, and the FormBorderStyle is Sizable. </li>
     
<li> The initial size is (800, 450) and the minimum size is (530, 380). </li>

<li> The form has a ReadOnly DataGridView of size (520, 220). It has six columns, and the column header text is
     "ID", "Last Name", "First Name", "Full Time", "Hire Date" and "Salary", respectively.
     It has a width of 50 for column ID, 95 for column Last Name and First Name, 70 for column Full Time, 80 for column Hire Date,
     and 70 for column Salary. </li>

<li> The DataGridView has a vertical scroll bar, but not the horizontal scroll bar. </li>

<li> The values of ID are centered, that of Last Name and First Name are left aligned,
     that of Hire Date and Salary are right aligned.
     The Hire Date is in the short date format, and Salary is in Currency format without any decimal digits. </li>

<li> There are two labels above the DataGridView.
     One label has text "Employees," and the other "Created by " followed by your full name. 
     The AutoSize of both labels is true.
     The font of the title label is MS Sans Serif 16, bold and underlined,
     and the font of the created label is MS Sans Serif 14, italic and underlined.  </li>

<li> The standard DataGridView binding navigator is on the top of the form,
     but the Add, Delete, and Save buttons are removed.
     The navigator has six additional ToolStripButtons, and the text is
     "Full Time," "Part Time," "All Employees," "Search on Salary," "Search on Last Name," and "Exit." </li>

<li> The form has a StatusStrip at the bottom. 
     The StatusStrip has three labels to display some useful information. 
     The first one displays the query information with boarder style RaisedOuter,
     the second displays the current date in long date format with boarder style RaisedInner,
     and the last one displays the current time in long time format with board style Raised. 
     All three labels are fixed size with width being 150, 180 and 120, respectively. </li>

<li> The query label will always be displayed to the left side of the StatusStrip,
     the time label will always be displayed to the right side, and the date label
     will always be next to the time label. </li>     
     
<li> The time displayed must be updated every two seconds and also after a query is executed. </li>     

<li> When the form is displayed, all records of table SalesStaff are listed in the grid, and the
     navigation commands on the navigator toolbar must work as expected.  
     The query label should display "All Employees," and both date and time should be displayed. </li>    

<li> Clicking on the Full Time button, only full time employees are displayed in the grid,
     and the query label will display "Full Time Employees."  </li>

<li> Clicking on the Part Time button, only part time employees are displayed in the grid,
     and the query label will display "Part Time Employees."  </li>

<li> Clicking on the All Employees button, all employees are displayed in the grid,
     the query label will display "All Employees."  </li>

<li> Clicking on the Search on Salary button, an inputbox will be displayed with title
     "Search on Salary" and prompt "Enter the salary lower limit: ".
     If the user enters a number and presses the OK button, then only employees with a salary
     greater than or equal to the entered limit will be displayed in the grid, 
     and the query label will display "Salary >= " followed by the entered limit in currency format
     without any decimal digits.
     If the user input does not represent a number, including strings such as "2e3",
     or the user clicks on the Cancel button, then nothing will change on the form. </li>

<li> Clicking on the Search on Last Name button, an inputbox will be displayed with title
     "Search on Last Name" and prompt "Enter the starting part of last name: ".
     If the user enters a string with at least one non-space character and presses the OK button, 
     then only employees whose last name start with the input string (after triming all spaces on both ends) 
     will be displayed in the grid, and the query label will display "Last Name starting with " followed by 
     the entered string (after triming all spaces on both ends) in <b>double quotes</b>.
     If the user input does not contain a non-space character,
     or the user clicks on the Cancel button, then nothing will change on the form. </li>

<li> (2 points) The search on last name should be case sensitive. </li>

<li> The total number of rows displayed on the navigation toolstrip should be updated to
     show the number of row of the current query.  </li>
     
<li> Clicking on the Exit button will terminate the program. </li>

<li> When the form is resized, including loaded at the beginning, the controls will be placed
     on the form as follows:
     <ul>
     <li> Horizontally, the left margin of the title label is 3/5 of the right margin of the title label;
          the left margin of the created label is 2/3 of the right margin of the created label;
          and the right margin of the grid is 5/8 of the left margin of the grid. </li>
     <li> Vertically, the space between the grid and the created label is the same as the bottom margin
          (the space between the datagridview and the statusstrip),
          which is 2/3 of the top margin (the space between the title label and the navigator), 
          and the space between the two labels is 1/3 of the top margin. </li>
     </ul>
     </li>
</ul>


<h5> Submission </h5>
<ul>
<li> Name your solution folder as UserName_Lab8 using your UserName and drop the entire folder
     to folder Lab8 of the class Dropbox by the due time. 
</li>
