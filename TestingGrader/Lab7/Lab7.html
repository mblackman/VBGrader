<p>
Create a VB.NET program in MS Visual Studio 2010 with one code module and
two form class, FormClassGrid and FormClassIndividual, to access database records.
</p>

<!-- Not a good ideas!

</p>
-->

<h5> Supporting files </h5>
<ul>
<li> The database file is MyCompany.mdb and it is located at S:\Courses\CSSE\yangq\CS2340\ReadOnly\DataBase.
You <b>must</b> copy it to your C:\Temp. </li>
<li> All other supporting files are also in the folder. </li>
</ul>

<h5> Code Module </h5>
<ul>
<li> You must have a code module with a main sub, and the startup object must be Sub Main (or Module). </li>
<li> The module must declare two variables, frmGrid of FormClassGrid and frmIndividual of FormClassIndividual. </li>
<li> Sub Main must create objects of the two form classes and assign them to frmGrid and frmIndividual, then start the program with frmGrid. </li>
</ul>

<h5> Class FormClassGrid </h5>
<ul>
<li> The form has its control box and its title is "Lab7" followed by your first and last names. 
     The StartPosition is center screen, the Window state is normal, and the FormBorderStyle is Sizable. </li>
     
<li> The initial size is (800, 350) and the minimum size is (520, 320). </li>

<li> The form has a DataGridView of size (524, 220). It has six columns, and the column header text is
     "ID", "Last Name", "First Name", "Full Time", "Hire Date" and "Salary", respectively.
     The width of column ID is 50, column Last Name and First Name 95, column Full Time and Salary 70,
     column Hire Date 80. </li>

<li> The ToolTipText of column ID is "Employee ID" and that of column Salary is "Annual Salary." </li> 

<li> The values of ID are centered, that of Last Name and First Name are left aligned,
     that of Hire Date and Salary are right aligned.
     The Hire Date is in the short date format, and Salary is in Currency format without any decimal digits. </li>

<li> There is a label above the DataGridView with text "Employees." 
     The AutoSize of the label is true, and the font is MS Sans Serif 14 and underlined.  </li>

<li> The standard DataGridView binding navigator toolbar is on the top of the form. Its back color is ControlDark.
     The toolbar has an additional refresh ToolStripButton with ToolTipText "Refresh." </li>

<li> When the form is displayed, all records of table SalesStaff are listed in the grid, and the
     items on the navigator toolbar must work as expected.  </li>    

<li> Right clicking on the DataGridView, a shortcut menu will be displayed with two menu items:
     Individual and Exit. The shortcut keys are Ctrl+I and Ctrl+X, respectively. </li>

<li> Clicking on Individual will hide the form and show frmIndividual, clicking on Exit 
     will terminate the program. </li>

<li> Clicking on the form close button in the form controlbox or pressing Alt+F4 will not close
     the form and the program continues to run. </li>

<li> When the form is resized, including loaded at the beginning, the controls will be placed
     on the form as follows:
     <ul>
     <li> Horizontally, both the title label and the grid will be in the center of the form. </li>
     <li> Vertically, the top margin is the same as the bottom margin, and the middle margin,
          the space between the title label and the grid, is 2/3 of the top margin. </li>
     </ul>
     </li>
</ul>


<h5> Class FormClassIndividual </h5>
<ul>
<li> The form has no control box and its title is "Lab7" followed by your first and last names. 
     The StartPosition is center screen, the Window state is normal, 
     the size is (580, 300) and the FormBorderStyle is Fixed3D. </li>
     
<li> The data for one employee is displayed on the form, and your form must be very
     similar to that of the sample program. </li>

<li> At the top of the form, there is a ToolStrip. The ToolStrip is very similar to the
     standard BindingNavigator, but you are NOT allowed to use the BindingNavigator,
     and you <b>must</b> setup the ToolStrip yourself. </li>
     
<li> The toolbar has eight ToolStripButtons, one ToolStripTextbox, one ToolStripLabel, and
     three ToolStripSeparators.  
     Your toolbar <b>must</b> be very similar to that of the sample program, including
     the image, text and tooltiptext. </li>
      
<li> The functionality of each item of the toolbar is the same
     as the corresponding item on the standard binding navigator toolbar.   </li> 

<li> All the navigation buttons must be enabled and disabled correctly all the times.   </li> 

<li> After clicking on button Add New, all buttons on the toolstrp should be disabled, except 
     the Save and Delete buttons. The user can enter data and click Save to save the new record to database
     or click Delete to discard the new record. All buttons should work normally after clicking
     Save or Delete.
     </li> 

<li> The position textbox is ReadOnly, and its text is center aligned. </li>

<li> Right clicking on the textbox for ID, Last Name, or First Name will popup a shortcut menu
     with two menu items: Grid and Exit. The shortcut keys are Ctrl+G and Ctrl+X, respectively. </li>

<li> Clicking on Grid will hide the form and show frmGrid, clicking on Exit 
     will terminate the program. </li>
</ul>


<h5> Submission </h5>
<ul>
<li> Name your solution folder as UserName_Lab7 using your UserName and drop the entire folder
     to folder Lab7 of the class Dropbox by the due time.  </li>
</ul>
